# Multicompany-Loyalty-Program-TokenModels-MonteCarloMethod
Monte Carlo Analysis on multiple complex Token Economy Models

The project consists of designing different Tokenomics (Tokeneconomy) Systems to support a blockchain-based Multicompany Loyalty Program (MCLP). A MCLP enables multiple companies boost sales and customer loyalty within the network by the issuance of rewards, i.e. in the form of "Tokens" which may be exchanged or redeeemed within the partner company network in order to incentivize spending. Ultimatley, the MCLP's goal is to proportionally increase value within the partner company network. The rules of the MCLP have to strike the right balance to both satisfy value expectations from the company and customer perspective, while operating within bounds of long-term profitability. 

Inspired by ICOs and using CoinMarketCap to perform benchamrking analyses I designed three distinct Token Models to deploy the MCLP on. 


An essential component shared by all three proposed tokenomics models is the integration of gamification features. These features are intricately woven into the rules and system design structure of each model, aiming to enhance consumer engagement and loyalty within the Multi- Company Loyalty Program (MCLP). The following section outlines these shared gamification elements and their specific implementations in the models.
A common thread in all models is the use of tier memberships. This approach categorizes consumers into different levels based on their total spending with partner companies. The more a customer spends, the higher their position in the tier system. This system not only incentivizes increased spending but also adds a sense of achievement and progress for the consumers. For those unable to meet the spending requirements to maintain their current tier within a specified period, the models typically provide a mechanism for tier descent, ensuring a dynamic and responsive system. To further encourage consumer spending and engagement, higher token issuance rates are applied to higher tiers. This feature directly rewards more active customers, fostering a sense of loyalty and incentivizing continuous interaction with partner companies.
Another gamification element is the leaderboard feature. In this setup, customers are ranked according to their total spending within a monthly cohort. The top performers, such as the top 1% or top 5%, are rewarded with additional tokens. This competitive aspect motivates customers to increase their spending to attain higher ranks and earn rewards, thereby driving engagement and loyalty.
The models also include a quest game feature, where customers face new challenges each month, such as shopping at specific partner companies. Successful completion of these quests results in token rewards from the central reserve. Quests can be strategically designed to direct consumer spending towards underperforming partner companies within the loyalty program. This approach ensures a balanced and equitable system for all partners. The quests are algorithmically generated based on the analysis of past transaction data, incorporating a level of decentralized decision-making into the loyalty program.
These gamification features are integral to the design and effectiveness of the tokenomics models. By embedding elements such as tier memberships, leaderboards, and quest games, the models aim to create an engaging and immersive experience for consumers. This approach not only fosters loyalty and repeated engagement but also ensures a fair distribution of benefits among all participating partner companies. The strategic use of gamification is crucial in maintaining the attractiveness and sustainability of the MCLP, making it a key factor in the success of the proposed tokenomics models. Another important feature common to all three tokenomics models is the incorporation of a democratic voting system for the inclusion of new partner companies into the Multi-Company Loyalty Program (MCLP).
The process begins with a proposal to add a new partner company to the MCLP. This proposal should be initiated by the governing body overseeing the loyalty program upon request from potential new joiners.
Each existing partner company in the MCLP is granted voting rights. This democratic approach ensures that all partners have a say in the evolution and expansion of the network. The voting is typically carried out through a secure and transparent digital platform, integrated within the MCLP's management system. This could be facilitated by the existing blockchain infrastructure underpinning the tokenomics models, leveraging its capabilities for secure and immutable voting records. The criteria for accepting a new partner company are predefined and could include factors such as market reputation, customer base, alignment with the loyalty program’s objectives, and potential synergies with existing partners. The decision to incorporate a new partner is based on a majority rule. The specific threshold for a majority can be predefined. Upon a successful vote, the new partner company is integrated into the MCLP. This involves setting up the necessary technical and operational frameworks to ensure seamless interaction with the existing tokenomics model and loyalty program structure.

Simple & Stable Model (Model 1):

As mentioned before, the first model is based on a private blockchain like some already existing projects developed for different companies, such as Chanticleer, Hitachi-PointInfinity, Gege Points, UnionPay, Singapore Airlines, Rakuten and Royal Bank of Canada (Wang et. al., 2018). This model involves two parties: partners and customers. In this model, for each transaction at a partner company, consumers receive an amount of tokens, which have a stable conversion rate. In turn, consumers can spend their loyalty points towards other existing partner companies within the ecosystem. Then, based on the gamification method, consumers are divided among themselves into distinct levels based on the total amount of money they spend on transactions with the partner companies. In practice, the more customers spend, the higher they get between tiers. In addition, if consumers are not able to cover, within a certain period, the number of purchases necessary to remain in the same tier, they descend. In this model, tokens’ supply is dynamic and related to demand and transactions volume. In the model, we see how consumers can redeem their TKN for purchases at any partner company at a stable redemption rate, i.e., 1 TKN = 0.5€; moreover, the issuance rate is fixed but differs between the different tiers. Given the stable nature of this tokenomics model, exposure to the public market is not intended or feasible. However, to make participation in the multicompany loyalty program more attractive, consumers have the option of converting their TKN into a fiat currency through a smart repurchase agreement. By paying a predefined commission to partners, consumers can liquidate their TKN. The TKN is proportionally returned to the issuing companies and can then be put back into circulation. The amount accumulated with the fees should be distributed among the partner companies in proportion to the issuance of the liquidated portfolio. In conclusion, in order to maintain a fair and effective loyalty program, a balancing mechanism is essential. Consumers often spend loyalty points impulsively, which can disadvantage companies. To solve this problem, a smart contract solution can be implemented to reduce the redemption rate when consumers use points earned from one company at another one. This strategy encourages consumers to spend points where they were earned, ensuring a more balanced and mutually beneficial loyalty program. An algorithmic approach could be used to maintain a balance between issuance and redemption across partners.
At the implementation level, the first model is developed on a private layer-1 blockchain, designed according to the principles of decentralisation and security. Layer-1 blockchain refers to the blockchain protocol that serves as the network's foundation. It is a distributed ledger technology (DLT) designed to securely record transactions on a private/public, immutable, and trustless ledger (Jie Xu et al., 2023). In this case, the network is private and managed by the partners participating in the loyalty programme. Each partner hosts one node of the network on its own server infrastructure, ensuring that nodes are distributed on independent servers. The process of validating transactions is entrusted to the algorithms of the smart contracts implemented on the blockchain. Smart contracts determine which node on the network will be responsible for the validation of each transaction (Neudecker & Hartenstein, 2018). Consumers participate in the loyalty programme via a mobile application (Android/iOS) or a web app. These platforms provide an intuitive interface for managing the consumer's token wallet. Through these apps, customers can view their wallet balance, monitor transactions, and participate in loyalty programme activities. Consumers can access their digital wallet to view their current token balance; this section provides details on the amount of tokens earned and spent, enabling transparent management of loyalty programme activities. A detailed transaction log is accessible to users, allowing them to track every token movement over time. This promotes transparency and trust in the system. Users can participate in special initiatives or promotions through the application. This could include registering for new partner services, participating in surveys, or other activities that provide consumers with the opportunity to earn additional tokens. Since the blockchain is private, consumer data and transactions are encrypted and only accessible to authorised actors. Security is built into every level of the system, from key management to encryption of data in transit. Blockchain maintenance and updates are managed collaboratively by partners. Smart contracts can be improved and adapted to meet the changing needs of the loyalty programme, ensuring the sustainability and evolution of the system over time. This Level 1 private blockchain implementation provides a robust technology infrastructure to support the complex dynamics of the first model and the proposed loyalty programme.

Open & Speculative Model (Model 2):

The second model to be evaluated is more publicly open and has speculative pricing. Unlike the others, the proposed model consists of volatile coin pricing according to the bonding curve and supply. A fixed amount of pre-mint tokens is issued before going live and locked up in a reserve. As the companies decide to join the program, they must acquire a minimum amount of tokens from the reserve at a fixed price. The amount of tokens unlocked from the reserve by the partner companies influences the program's initial token’s value, determined by the position on the bonding curve at the supply of tokens in circulation. Partner companies have two management options for their token holdings. First, keep them in circulation for the token- economy, thus, for circulation. Adjustments to the staking balance can only be done in monthly intervals. Second stake a share of their tokens, thus, isolating them from circulation, and increasing their chances to earn rewards from the PoS validation mechanism, to be conducted exclusively by partner companies for all transactions involving token issuance or redemptions. For each block a predefined number of partner companies is selected as validators. The likelihood to be selected as validator node is dependent on a weighted metrics, including the absolute amount of token staked, and the relative amount of token staked. Throughout the program, the model follows an adjustable but predetermined issuance rate that is designed by an algorithm and various parameters (like the current token price and circulating supply). In order to preserve the steadiness of the coin value and create trust in the community, periodic adjustments (on a monthly basis) and open communication with the stakeholders are foreseen. Post-purchase, these tokens are held for reward distribution, with options for companies to replenish their holdings as needed or for staking and reserving for customers. In essence, partner companies function as both the initial "buyers" and "distributors" of the token. They buy tokens as a stake in the system and then distribute them as rewards based on a customer's purchasing behaviour and the prevailing issuance rate. The adjustable issuance rate ensures that the rewards remain dynamic, attractive, and sustainable over time. When a customer makes a purchase at a partner company, the amount spent is multiplied by the current issuance rate (also dependent on the Tier membership) to determine the number of tokens the customer should receive as a reward from the company’s holdings in their wallet. Tokens can be used for redemption in exchange for a good or reward in partner companies or trading. Upon redemption the model remains circular, as the token redeemed are injected into the partner companies’ liquid wallet. As for gamification, model 2, integrates the common gamification features. Given the Model’s incorporation of active staking mechanism it employs decentralized decision-making, where stakeholders, including partner companies and consumers, are given a say in the program's rules and directions. Voting is conducted through a token-based system, where each token represents a vote. Proposals subject to voting may include adjustments to the program's parameters, algorithmic quests and issuance rates, or decisions about including or excluding new partner companies. To facilitate this, partners and customers should have access to a voting portal, which allows them to view active proposals and request new ones.
At the implementation level, the model is developed on a public level 2 blockchain, designed according to the principles of decentralisation and security. A layer-2 blockchain refers to network protocols that overlap with a layer-1 solution. Layer 2 protocols use layer 1 blockchain for network infrastructure and security but are more flexible in their ability to scale transaction processing and overall network throughput (Sguanci et al., 2021). Potentially, the model could be developed as a layer 2 solution on the Ethereum, Polkadot, Cardano or Binance Smart Chain blockchains, through respectively the Solidity5, Rust6, Haskell7 and again Solidity8 programming languages. For each case, a smart contract that regulates the pre-minting and the reserve have to be developed; the same smart contract will contain the bonding curve mechanism which will influence the token’s price after the initial token distribution. The phase following development consists of compiling the smart contract using a special compiler, such as Truffle or Remix on Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain, cargo-contract on Polkadot and plutus-playgroud on Cardano. Once the smart contract has been compiled, the deployment can be conducted, which should first take place on a test network, so as to verify the correct functioning of the model, and then on the main network. Also, for the second model, consumers participate in the loyalty programme via a mobile application (Android/iOS) or web app. As in the first model, customers will be able to access their digital wallet to view their current token balance, the amount of tokens earned and spent, enabling transparent management of loyalty programme activities. A detailed transaction log is accessible to users, allowing them to track every token movement over time. This promotes transparency and trust in the system. The mobile and web apps should allow users to view active proposals, vote and propose changes to the programme, ensuring fair and transparent participation in the management of the ecosystem. Blockchain maintenance and updates are managed collaboratively by partners. Smart contracts can be improved and adapted to meet the changing needs of the loyalty programme, ensuring the sustainability and evolution of the system over time. This implementation of a public level 2 blockchain provides a robust technology infrastructure to support the complex dynamics of the second model and the proposed loyalty programme.

Sidechain Model (Model 3):

Model 3 employs a closed ecosystem with sidechain technology, an approach that empowers individual companies within the multi-brand loyalty program with their own dedicated coins. These coins are seamlessly connected to a central common coin which is managed by a third party such as Celfocus, facilitating the conversion of loyalty coins across partner businesses. In this model, the entrance of new partners in the ecosystem is based on the majority vote of existing partners and third party. Beforehand, participating companies collaboratively agree on conversion rates, which are then encoded into smart contracts. This streamlined process not only eases the integration of new partner companies but also ensures a harmonious flow of loyalty transactions.
One of the standout features of this model is its emphasis on user experience. Every consumer is granted a distinct avatar. By completing periodic tasks, they can earn badges, which are also apparent on their personal profile. These badges come with some specific features, such as discount coupons or higher conversion rates from purchases. With every purchase, clients will be rewarded with coins corresponding to the amount spent. In order to create a community around this ecosystem and encourage competition, consumers may see other interacted consumers points and badges on the leaderboard. By implementing personalization, it is aimed at sparking intrinsic motivation while transforming the mundane act of earning loyalty points into an engaging and interactive journey. Earned coins hold tangible value and can be utilized in two flexible ways: clients have the option to redeem them directly with the partner company, enjoying instant benefits, or they can convert these coins into the platform's common currency. The latter option offers unparalleled flexibility, allowing clients to store their converted coins until they find the perfect opportunity to utilize them with any of the participating partner companies. This freedom of choice not only enhances user satisfaction but also encourages long-term engagement with the loyalty program. At the implementation level, choosing the sidechain on which to develop the model's smart contract requires an analysis of its ability to scale, be secure, have low transaction costs, be widely adopted, and have an adequate level of developer and community support. There are several sidechains based on different blockchains that exhibit these characteristics. Among them there is Polygon, a widely supported and popular Ethereum-based solution that provides a scalable infrastructure and low transaction costs. Either the Truffle suite or the OpenZeppelin suite can be used to develop and compile the smart contract, and these suites need to be configured in order to get a connection to the Polygon network. Without that connection the smart contract could not be deployed on it (Sutopo, 2023). As in the first and second models, consumers will participate in the loyalty programme via a mobile application (Android/iOS) or web app. In this case also, customers will be able to access their digital wallet to view their current token balance, the amount of tokens earned and spent, enabling transparent management of loyalty programme activities. A detailed transaction log is accessible to users, allowing them to track every token movement over time. This promotes transparency and trust in the system. The mobile and web apps should allow users to view active proposals, vote and propose changes to the programme, ensuring fair and transparent participation in the management of the ecosystem. Blockchain maintenance and updates are managed collaboratively by partners. Smart contracts can be improved and adapted to meet the changing needs of the loyalty programme, ensuring the sustainability and evolution of the system over time. This implementation of a sidechain provides a robust technology infrastructure to support the complex dynamics of the third model and the proposed loyalty programme.
