# Multicompany-Loyalty-Program-TokenModels-MonteCarloMethod
Monte Carlo Analysis on multiple complex Token Economy Models

The project consists of designing different Tokenomics (Tokeneconomy) Systems to support a blockchain-based Multicompany Loyalty Program (MCLP). A MCLP enables multiple companies boost sales and customer loyalty within the network by the issuance of rewards, i.e. in the form of "Tokens" which may be exchanged or redeeemed within the partner company network in order to incentivize spending. Ultimatley, the MCLP's goal is to proportionally increase value within the partner company network. The rules of the MCLP have to strike the right balance to both satisfy value expectations from the company and customer perspective, while operating within bounds of long-term profitability. 

Inspired by ICOs and using CoinMarketCap to perform benchamrking analyses I designed three distinct Token Models to deploy the MCLP on.
